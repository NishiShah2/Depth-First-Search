# Depth-First-Search
**_Depth-First-Search(DFS) Artificial Intelligence Algorithm using Python_** <br>
**_Depth First Search_** is used to traverse a graph or a tree it can be explored by root node or any arbitary node and it is traversed by selecting that node and traversing to its leaf node that means till the depth node. After reaching the leaf node (ie end node) then back track to its immediate parent node and not to the root node.

**_Procedure_**
1. Start from root node or any arbitary node <br>
2. Traverse from that node till the leaf node (ie end node or dead end)
3. Then back track (ie come back to the immediate parent which is not traversed) to the immediate parent node
4. Repeat till all the nodes are traversed
5. Stop
